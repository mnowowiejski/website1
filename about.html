      <h1>About Markus</h1>
      <p>
        <img src="assets/images/creed.jpg" align="right" style="margin: 5px;" width="150" alt="Creed picture" />I generally tell people I am too busy to tell them about myself and to just go read the wikipedia article for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creed_Bratton_(character)" target="_blank">Creed Bratton</a> and assume that is fairly accurate. But, if you must know more, I am a Baltimore native who lives in Fells Point and works at Johns Hopkins University.  I prefer to spend a bulk of my time yelling at the TV, especially during Ravens games, The Walking Dead and Game of Thrones.  I also frequent Las Vegas as rate suggestive of heavy mob ties but actually just have an obscene amount of air miles from my previous job that will eventually expire.

      <h1>Why Mark is here</h1>
      <p>I am here at <a href="https://betamore.com" target="_blank">Betamore</a> because I need to update my woefully out of date web skills.  Years of being constricted to a proprietary LMS/CMS have left me falling behind, espcially when it comes to responsive web design and javascript.  I am hoping my new skills can help me expand my base of contract/freelance gigs so I can stop going to work an sit in a cubicle, which I think we can all agree is childish and stupid. Clearly I should be and home with this dog.
